# mgcnn

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for classifying standard and modified gravity (MG) cosmological models based on the weak-lensing convergence maps they generate.

This repository contains the data and code to reproduce the results in [Distinguishing standard and modified gravity cosmologies with machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11030) (Peel et al. 2018).
